# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-reviews-for-Echo-dot

PROBLEM STATEMENT

1) Deep Learning - Use this dataset to detect age: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/faces-age-detection-dataset. Build two deep models - one from scratch and the other using a pretrained model to obtain embeddings of the given data. Compare the performances.

2) NLP - Scrape about 5000 reviews on any product of your choice on Amazon along with their ratings (1-5). Considering reviews with 1-2 as 'negative' and 4-5 as 'positive', develop an NBC classifier.
